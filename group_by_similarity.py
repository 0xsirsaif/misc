"""
Given: n number of strings of any length, can you come up with a compute-efficient method to group them by similarity
in the string characters
Please note, this is not vector clustering. Do not use any method that infers an embedding from the text please.

Example:
The cat sat on the mat.
The cat sat on the hat.
Pizza is yummy.
The mouse sat on the mat.
Pizza is hot.
Mountain climbing is great.
Sausage is yummy.

The above list would form 3 to 6 clusters depending on the selected threshold.

For this question, compute efficient, in this case, means it is must more efficient than O(n^2).
